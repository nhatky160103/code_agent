# 🎮 Bloxorz-like 3D Puzzle Game – Technical Specification

## 1. Overview

This is a **3D isometric puzzle game** inspired by *Bloxorz*.

* The game is rendered in **true 3D** (tiles have thickness, blocks have height, real-time shadows).
* A **fixed isometric / angled top-down camera** is used (no free camera rotation).
* The player controls a **rectangular 3D block (2×1×1)** that rolls over floating platforms.
* The goal is to place the block **standing upright** on the target hole tile.

---

## 2. Core Gameplay Objective

* Move the block across the map using valid rotations.
* Avoid falling off the map or triggering invalid tiles.
* Complete the level when the block:

  * Is **standing vertically**
  * Is positioned **exactly on the Goal tile**

---

## 3. Block Mechanics

### 3.1 Block States

The block has three possible states:

* **Standing (Vertical)**: occupies 1 tile
* **Lying X**: occupies 2 tiles along the X-axis
* **Lying Z**: occupies 2 tiles along the Z-axis

### 3.2 Movement Rules

* Controlled using **Arrow Keys / WASD**
* Each move performs a **90° rotation around the block’s edge**
* After every move, the system must validate:

  * Whether the block is still within map bounds
  * Whether the tiles beneath the block are valid

---

## 4. Level Map Structure

### 4.1 Representation

* Levels are defined using a **2D grid (matrix)** for logic
* Each grid cell corresponds to a **3D tile mesh** in the scene

Example (logical layout):

```text
0 0 0 0 0
0 1 1 1 0
0 1 G 1 0
0 0 0 0 0
```

---

## 5. Tile Types

### 5.1 Basic Tiles

* **Normal Tile**: supports any block state
* **Empty Tile**: causes the block to fall → level reset
* **Goal Tile**: level completes only if block is standing

### 5.2 Special Tiles

#### 🔸 Fragile Tile

* Supports the block **only when lying flat**
* If the block stands vertically → tile breaks → fall

#### 🔘 Switch Tiles

**Soft Switch (O)**

* Activated when any part of the block touches it

**Hard Switch (X)**

* Activated only when the block is standing vertically

Switches can:

* Open or close bridges
* Toggle other tiles on the map

---

## 6. Teleport & Split Mechanics

### 6.1 Teleport Tile

* When the block stands on this tile, it is moved to a target position

### 6.2 Split Block Tile

* Splits the block into **two 1×1×1 cubes**
* Each cube can be controlled independently
* Cubes can:

  * Activate switches separately
  * Merge back into a 2×1×1 block when positioned correctly

---

## 7. Failure Conditions

* Any part of the block moves outside the map
* The block stands on a fragile tile
* No valid tile exists beneath the block

→ Level resets

---

## 8. Win Condition

* The block is **standing upright**
* The block is **perfectly aligned on the Goal tile**

---

## 9. Level Design Guidelines

* Recommended number of levels: **30–40**
* Difficulty progression:

  1. Basic movement
  2. Switch mechanics
  3. Fragile tiles
  4. Teleport and split mechanics
* Optional level passcodes for progress saving

---

## 10. Controls & UI

### Controls

* Arrow Keys / WASD: move block
* `R`: reset level
* `Space`: switch control between split cubes

### UI Elements

* Move counter
* Level indicator / passcode
* Reset button

---

## 11. Technical Implementation (3D Focus)

### 11.1 Coordinate System

* Gameplay logic remains **grid-based (2D)** for precision
* Each tile is rendered as a **3D cube mesh**
* Block dimensions:

  * Width: 1 tile
  * Height: 2 tiles
  * Depth: 1 tile

RenderPosition = GridPosition × TileSize

---

### 11.2 Camera

* Fixed **isometric camera**
* Suggested angles:

  * X rotation: 45°–60°
  * Y rotation: 45°
* Camera does not rotate during gameplay

---

### 11.3 Block Animation

* Each move triggers:

  * A **90° rotation around the contact edge**
  * Smooth easing (ease-in-out)
* Animation duration: **0.2–0.35 seconds**

---

### 11.4 Lighting & Materials

* Directional light + ambient light
* Tile materials:

  * Normal: gray
  * Fragile: orange
  * Goal: recessed hole
* Block:

  * Stone or metal material
  * Real-time shadows enabled

---

### 11.5 Recommended Technologies

* **Unity 3D** (preferred)
* **Three.js** (Web-based)
* **Godot 3D**

---

## 12. Optional Enhancements

* Undo / redo system
* Best-move scoring
* Sound effects and particles
* Level completion animation

---

## 13. Expected Outcome

A clean and challenging 3D puzzle game that:

* Emphasizes spatial reasoning
* Uses deterministic, grid-based logic
* Faithfully recreates the feel of *Bloxorz* while allowing future extensions
